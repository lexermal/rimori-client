# Simple Flashcards - User Guide

## Getting Started

Simple Flashcards uses spaced repetition to help you learn and retain information efficiently. The plugin automatically schedules your reviews at optimal intervals, showing cards just before you're likely to forget them.

### Create Your First Deck

Before you can start learning, you'll need to create a deck to organize your flashcards. To create your first deck:

1. Navigate to the main flashcards page where you'll see your deck overview
2. Click the "Add deck" button located at the bottom of the page
3. Enter a descriptive name for your deck (e.g., "Spanish Vocabulary" or "Biology Terms")
4. Click save to create your new deck

Your new deck will appear in the deck overview, ready for you to add flashcards.

### Adding Flashcards

Once you have a deck, you can start adding flashcards to build your learning material. To add new flashcards:

1. Click on your deck name to enter the deck and access its training interface
2. Click the "+" button to open the flashcard creation form
3. Enter your question, word, or prompt on the **front** of the card
4. Enter the corresponding answer, translation, or explanation on the **back**
5. Optionally add tags like `lang:es` to enable features such as Spanish audio pronunciation
6. Click the save icon to create your flashcard

The new card will be added to your deck and will appear in your learning session when you start reviewing.

### Learning with Flashcards

The learning process follows a simple but effective pattern designed to maximize retention:

1. **Start a session** by clicking on a deck name from the overview page
2. **Study the front** of each card carefully and try to recall the answer from memory
3. **Reveal the answer** by pressing the spacebar or clicking the "Show answer" button
4. **Rate your recall** honestly using one of four options:
   - **Again (1)** - You didn't remember or got it wrong; the card will reappear soon
   - **Hard (2)** - You remembered but with significant difficulty; shorter interval before next review
   - **Good (3)** - You remembered correctly with some effort; optimal spaced interval
   - **Easy (4)** - You remembered effortlessly; longer interval before next review

Your ratings help the algorithm determine the best time to show each card again, optimizing your learning efficiency.

## Key Features

### Audio Pronunciation Support

For language learning, audio pronunciation is essential. The plugin supports text-to-speech functionality:

- **Enable audio** by adding language tags such as `lang` for generic audio or `lang:es` for Spanish-specific pronunciation
- **Play audio** by clicking the speaker icon that appears on cards with language tags
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for audio: press **5** to play the front audio or **h** to play the back audio

The audio feature helps you learn correct pronunciation while building vocabulary, making it especially valuable for language learners.

### Efficient Keyboard Navigation

Speed up your review sessions with keyboard shortcuts that eliminate the need for mouse clicking:

- **Spacebar** - Reveal the answer when studying the front of a card
- **Number keys 1-4** - Rate your recall (Again, Hard, Good, Easy respectively)
- **5 key** - Play audio for the front of the card (if language tags are present)
- **h key** - Play audio for the back of the card (if language tags are present) 
- **v key** - Edit the current flashcard during review

These shortcuts allow you to maintain focus and rhythm during your learning sessions.

### Deck Organization and Progress Tracking

The deck overview provides clear visual indicators of your progress:

- **Orange numbers** next to deck names show cards you're actively learning (new or recently difficult cards)
- **Green numbers** indicate cards that are due for review today based on the spaced repetition schedule
- **Deck names** can be clicked to immediately start a study session with that deck

This system helps you quickly identify which decks need attention and track your daily progress.

### Tagging System for Organization

Tags provide a flexible way to categorize and enhance your flashcards:

- **Organizational tags** like `grammar`, `verbs`, or `beginner` help you categorize content by topic or difficulty
- **Language tags** such as `lang:de` for German enable specific features like pronunciation
- **Multiple tags** can be applied to each card for comprehensive organization

Tags make it easier to manage large collections of flashcards and enable special features like audio playback.

## Settings and Customization

The plugin offers several settings to personalize your learning experience:

- **Auto-play new cards** - When enabled, automatically plays audio pronunciation for new cards that have appropriate language tags, helping you learn pronunciation from the first encounter
- **Auto-add lookups** - Automatically creates flashcards from words you look up in other parts of the Rimori workspace, streamlining the process of building your vocabulary deck

These settings help integrate the flashcard system with your broader learning workflow.

## Best Practices and Tips

To get the most out of your flashcard learning:

- **Keep cards simple** - Focus on one concept, word, or fact per card for optimal retention
- **Review consistently** - Even a brief 10-minute daily session is more effective than longer, infrequent sessions
- **Use audio features** - Take advantage of pronunciation features for language learning
- **Edit problematic cards** - If you consistently struggle with a card, rewrite it to be clearer or break it into smaller pieces
- **Be honest with ratings** - Accurate self-assessment helps the algorithm schedule reviews optimally

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Audio not playing when expected?**
- Verify that your device volume is turned up and not muted
- Check that the flashcard has proper language tags (e.g., `lang:en` for English)
- Try refreshing the page if audio features seem unresponsive

**Flashcards not saving properly?**
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for data synchronization
- Verify you clicked the save icon after entering card content
- Try creating the card again if the first attempt failed

**Progress not updating correctly?**
- Refresh the page to ensure you're seeing the latest data
- Check that you're rating cards rather than just viewing them
